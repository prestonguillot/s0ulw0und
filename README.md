This is a mIRC script that was my pride and joy circa ~2000, and the first thing I ever did that could reasonably considered programming. Contained within are gems like my discovery of looping constructs, evolving beyond GOTO's. It is here purely for my own personal nostalgia, but if you want to make fun of it, by all means, 15 year old me _derserves_ roasting.
